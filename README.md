These files contain the code written to play the River Crossing Puzzle game.

A river crossing puzzle is a type of puzzle in which the object is to carry items from one river bank to another. The difficulty of the puzzle arises from restrictions on how many items can be transported at the same time, or which items may be safely left together.

This project attempted to recreate this puzzle in a form where it could be solved through physical interactive play.
The puzzle selected required 3 goats and 3 tigers to be transported without ever having more tigers than goats on a side.
The tigers and goats were represented by red and white totems respectively. A lighted button on the top of the totem was used to place them on the boat to move them to the opposite bank. If totems were moved without pressing the button the player would have to start the game from scratch.
